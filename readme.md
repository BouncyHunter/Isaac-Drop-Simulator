# Isaac Drop Simulator

A website that simulates <<The Binding Of Isaac: Rebirth>>'s room clear drops a multiple of times and works out a familiar drop rate with statistics.
Based on [wiki](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.com/Room_Clear_Awards)

open *index.html* or visit [my website](http://huangpeiyao.club/isaac/) to access the simulator.

## TODO list

1. Add icons;
2. Rearrange UI design.
